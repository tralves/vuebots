This repo contains the code from the talk "VUEJS POWERED FLUFFY KILLING ROBOTS".

(link to talk will go here soon)

#### `reactivity/`

`reactivity/` contains the first experiments using `@vue/reactivity` to control LEDs, react to (physical) buttons and potentiometers.

#### `components/`

In `components/`, we use `@vue/runtime-test` to create `Led` and `Button` components that can be mounted and "rendered" together.

#### `vuebot3000/`

![alt text!](https://github.com/tralves/vuebots/raw/master/docs/vuebot3000.png "Vuebot 3000!")

A vuebot capable of expressing the full range of human emotion: sadness/happiness and evil/good.

Uses vue components compose the robot logic and even a "use function" to abstract eye blinking.
